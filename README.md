  Gatsby's default starter for an MVP with Fauna serverless database and GraphQL
</h1>

<p>
  It is a starter Gatsby project that we'll use to build a real MVP with
  authentication and a few social features with as little coding as
  possible.
</p>
<p>
  Watch me doing it or take part in this exciting process to learn, how
  powerful JAMstack is when combined with Fauna serverless database.
</p>

<h2>In this article, we will connect our MVP to the FaunaDB to source data from there at build time, and present is as static pages</h2>
<p>The GraphQL schema is in <code>schemas/schema-article-1.gql</code></p>
